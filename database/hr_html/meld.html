These APIs also empower developers to effortlessly integrate intricate financial services—from money transfers to loan applications—into user-friendly apps.\n\nAPIs are also pivotal in facilitating the secure, real-time exchange of user-permissioned data between different financial platforms. This has fostered a more unified and efficient financial ecosystem and allowed customers to have better control over their financial data.\n\nAdditionally, open banking APIs have created a fertile ground for third-party developers to sow the seeds of novel financial services.

P2P platforms offer an efficient, online-centric alternative to traditional bank loans. By connecting borrowers directly with investors, these platforms bypass many of the traditional banking intermediaries, resulting in quicker loan approval processes and often more competitive interest rates. Similarly, equity crowdfunding platforms have democratized access to capital, enabling individuals and small businesses to raise funds from a broader base of investors.\n\nThe integration of fintech APIs into these platforms has been a game-changer.

The explosion has resulted in chaos for developers who need to manage numerous integrations to support their product and growth ambitions. The following scenario to building a fintech stack might sound familiar: developers start building their product embedding third party integrations to support their use case. As the business scales, it requires more solutions — quickly resulting in a fragmented multi-layered “stack” of fintech services. This chaos will only grow, as fragmentation of services in the fintech stack increases.\n\nBut what if you could future proof your infrastructure and build for growth without needing to waste product and engineering hours on managing the chaos of your stack? That’s where Meld comes in — a platform that provides a “Fintech Stack as a Service” to enable developers to integrate and manage the services their products need. Meld manages the full stack of fintech services for companies — integrating the third party services for your business model into one, simple API and extensible integrated platform. Meld reduces the friction of launching new products and expanding into new markets and enables businesses to achieve their growth.\n\nWe’re coming out of stealth with use cases across Crypto \u0026 Payments and Bank Linking. Web3 platforms are working with Meld to connect into multiple crypto on-ramps to maximize global coverage across tokens, countries, and currencies. Fintechs are connecting into our Bank Linking Stack to access multiple account aggregators to increase institution coverage and conversion rates. And software companies are hooking into our Payments Stack to add and manage payment providers easily as they expand their business.\n\nAs we make it easier for developers to launch fintech products globally across varied demographics, use cases, and business models, we hope we’ll be a small part of bringing financial services to the next billion people. This is a future we are deeply committed to and excited about.\n\nWe’re fortunate to have built Meld with a team that combines experiences at Square, Paypal, Amazon, Wish, Flexport, and Brex. This team understands what we are solving for and share our vision of providing a fintech stack across key experiences to help save developers time as they build their products.\n\nWe are so thankful to our early customers who have taken a bet on a small team with a big vision — companies like Abra, TicketSocket, Ice Cream Social and others are already working with Meld to manage their fintech stack.\n\nFinally, we’re also so excited to share that this idea was incubated and supported by Michael Gilroy, Saanya Ojha, and the wonderful team at Coatue, who also led our Seed round of $8MM. And we’re supported by an an incredible group of angels supporting us on our journey including Adam Nash (LinkedIn, Wealthfront, Daffy), Akash Garg (CTO at Afterpay), Emil Michael (first Chief Business Officer and early leader at Uber), Eric Glyman and Karim Atiyeh (co-founders of Ramp), Gokul Rajaram (Doordash, Square, Google), Greg Kidd (early investor in Coinbase, Square, Twitter), Jackie Reses (Square, Yahoo, Apax Partners), Scott Fletcher and Hugh Norton-Smith at Intersection Growth Partners, and 20+ others to name a few.
